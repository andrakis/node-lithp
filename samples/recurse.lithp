% Sample: recurse
%
% Purpose: Demonstrate tail recursion via the recurse/* builtin.
%
% Notes:   You must provide the function name of the function you
%          wish to recurse. Presently this cannot be detected.
%
%          Also note that the stack depth remains constant when run
%          with the debug flag (-d).
